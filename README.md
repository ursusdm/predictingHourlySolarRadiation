## One-day-ahead prediction of hourly global solar radiation.

This project distributes code and files associated to the paper entitled "Binding data mining and expert knowledge for one-day-ahead prediction of hourly global solar radiation"

It includes:
a) description (values) of the 14 centroids used to characterized 14 types of days.
b) demo training dataset and code to conduct the first and second phases of the methodology, and 
c) code to perform the prediction phase, configured with the best models determined in the paper.

Code in R files is prepared to be executed in sequential order (every file offers a specific functionality).
